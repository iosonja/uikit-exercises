# uikit-exercises
### The repository contains my solutions to Paul Hudson's 100 Days of Swift challenge.
### The challenge is about building small iOS apps built using UIKit. 

#### The "Tutorial-based exercises" folder contains apps that are built on top of 
#### tutorials and only slightly modified by me. The "Built from Scratch" folder 
#### only contains projects that are made by me from start to finish.
